# navier-stokes-advection-diffusion-2D
This code gives visualizations of the Navier Stokes Advection Diffusion Equations with added vorticity. We used a finite difference approximation of the Laplacian, and the Fast Fourier Transform to integrate the PDE.
In order to start, you will want to modify the function initial_omega(x,y), which is the initial condition for the fluid flow to begin. Then there are three plotters to allow you to visualize the fluid flow. The first is the 2D Top Down Heat Map Plotter, which allows you to see the top down view of the vorticity omega(x,y,t) function as it is integrated in time for the given PDE. The second is the GIF Creator, which will create a gif of the fluid flow with the same visual as the 2D Top Down Heat Map Plotter. Then the third plotter allows you to visualize the function omega(x,y,t) in three dimensions, where we plot (x,y,omega(x,y,t)) and evolve it in time. I have some of the plotters commented out, so depending on which one you want to use you can comment out the other ones.

I have example python files given with their corresponding GIF output, so you can get an idea of how the code works and what kind of visuals you can make. All the examples are modifications of the main file 2D Navier Stokes Advection Diffusion Equations.
